# nextcloud-app-phpunit

Just some utitlity classes shared between some of my nextcloud apps, in order to avoid code duplication. This is not meant as standalone-package. Currently it is used by [rotdrop/cafevdb](https://github.com/rotdrop/cafevdb) and [rotdrop/cafevdb-members](https://github.com/rotdrop/cafevdb-members).
